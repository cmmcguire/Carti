# Carti

***Status:

So Firebase has been set up for this app. I added Firebase to the Android project and followed
the "Before you begin" steps on the link below so we should be set upo and ready to go for
the text recognition later on.

Added a variety of features so yall can practice and understand how to program on android. Code includes comments with whats happening. Currently the app works as a counter which includes two buttons. The top button displays a welcome message that fades out of the screen after 2.5 seconds and the bottom button updates the number in the middle of the screen, counting how many times youve pressed the button. I will be slowly adding features as im learning and removing others until the features fit for what we need. Hope my code can help you guys understand Android.

Also, this file is to keep everyone updated so any changes you make, report them here using this format with three * which makes a word bolded when file is opened so that things are easier to track.

Minor update: changed the package name in MainActivity back to com.project.carti as we were getting an error there. Also changed the name of this file back to README.md just because that's the filename GitHub automatically identifies and opens at the bottom of the repo page.
