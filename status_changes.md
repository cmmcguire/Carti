# Carti

IMPORTANT NOTE: Report status messages to the README file on the MASTER BRANCH (branches might reflect different changes)

***Status:

So Firebase has been set up for this app. I added Firebase to the Android project and followed
the "Before you begin" steps on the link below so we should be set upo and ready to go for
the text recognition later on.

***Status 02/13/20:

Added a variety of features so yall can practice and understand how to program on android. Code includes comments with whats happening. Currently the app works as a counter which includes two buttons. The top button displays a welcome message that fades out of the screen after 2.5 seconds and the bottom button updates the number in the middle of the screen, counting how many times youve pressed the button. I will be slowly adding features as im learning and removing others until the features fit for what we need. Hope my code can help you guys understand Android.

Also, this file is to keep everyone updated so any changes you make, report them here using this format with three * which makes a word bolded when file is opened so that things are easier to track.

***Status 2/14/20:

Minor update: changed the package name in MainActivity back to com.project.carti as we were getting an error there. Also changed the name of this file back to README.md just because that's the filename GitHub automatically identifies and opens at the bottom of the repo page.

Added new branch test-text-recognition. If you check out that branch, I have a basic implementation of the text recognition using Firebase working. I made 2 buttons, one called Camera and the other called Detect. If you hit Camera, it allows you to take a picture. Afterwards, if you hit detect, it scans the image for text and reports the result. Implemented with help from tutorials by Google and Medium.

***Status 4/02/20

Added a new Branch called Top_Menu_Bar. Inside this branch their is a zip file which contains the feature. Files could not be merged so I left it all in the zip file. The important files are the new classes and xml files that accompany them. Including, a few changes to app:gradel which compiles the code. TODO(Other pages such as delete, tax and cart items still need to be implemented)
Classes: 
About_Page (TODO)
Add_Item_Page(Contains the form for manual input, contains error checking)
Delete_Item_Page(TODO)
Grocery_List_Page(TODO)
MainActivity(Creates class instances)
Tax_Page(TODO put slider) -> UPDATE

Included the slider to the tax page to display a number when slider is moved. Functions should allow you to retrieve value from the users input. Added a progress bar to show how much the tax has changed.
